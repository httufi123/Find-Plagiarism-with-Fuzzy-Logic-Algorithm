# Fing Plagiarism with Fuzzy Logic Algorithm
It gains great importance in trying to prevent plagiarism while keeping up with the online world. I tried to make a small contribution to its prevention. You can find plagiarism in the texts and codes. 
# Definition and Purpose of the Study
The source code similarity project is basically a very common program. The reason for this is that data is taken and used without the user's permission or knowledge from both codes and documentation in various formats. In order to prevent this and to follow the legal processes, the importance of such programs is increasing day by day.
Fuzzy Logic algorithm was used while finding code similarity. Although the Fuzzy Logic algorithm is one of the decision mechanisms that brings a machine closer to the human, it plays a very important role in determining the similarity in the application, as it also deals with the qualitative and semantic elements.
The Fuzzy Logic algorithm will be described through an example below. But if we want to explain in the shortest way, it gives us that the probabilities are not just 0 and 1, but there are other possibilities that can occur between 0 and 1, by blurring the range of 0 and 1.
Fuzzy logic is a concept that first emerged in 1965 by Dr Lotfi A Zadeh, with the publication of an article on this subject in the journal "Information and Control". Fuzzy logic is a very valuable form of logic that deals with approximate and reasonable values ​​rather than exact and exact values.
Fuzzy logic keeps intermediate values ​​such as very long-long-medium-short-very short instead of long-short, as in human logic, and everything is represented by values ​​in the [0,1] range. In summary, fuzzy logic method is preferred if the results in a system do not need to be defined precisely, if the results are desired to be displayed in range values, or if mathematical criteria need to be determined and classified as adjectives.
# The architecture of the Fuzzy Logic algorithm is as follows:

# Cosine Similarity Method 
This method calculates the similarity between two ordinal numbers based on the following formula.

Thanks to the value calculated with this formula, we can calculate the similarity between the digitized texts.
